init only:

Starting Thread:Thread-5
Background process successfully started.
Starting Thread:Thread-6

Starting Thread:Thread-7
Waiting ... Thread-5

==========================

init + destroy - with synchronized notify:

1. use notify() as synchronized way

Starting Thread:Thread-5
Background process successfully started.
Waiting ... Thread-5
Starting Thread:Thread-6
Background process successfully started.
Starting Thread:Thread-7
Waiting ... Thread-6
Background process successfully started.
Waiting ... Thread-7
Start stopping processor threads in thread: main
Page Repainting ... Thread-5
Thread successfully stopped. Thread-5

... suspended ...

-------------------------------------------------

2. use notifyAll() as synchronzied way

Starting Thread:Thread-5
Background process successfully started.
Waiting ... Thread-5
Starting Thread:Thread-6
Background process successfully started.
Waiting ... Thread-6
Starting Thread:Thread-7
Background process successfully started.
Start stopping processor threads in thread: main
Waiting ... Thread-7
Page Repainting ... Thread-7
Page Repainting ... Thread-5
Page Repainting ... Thread-6
Thread successfully stopped. Thread-5
Thread successfully stopped. Thread-6
Thread successfully stopped. Thread-7

Total during time: 3 milliseconds

conclusion: use notifyAll() where necessary for multiple version listener
