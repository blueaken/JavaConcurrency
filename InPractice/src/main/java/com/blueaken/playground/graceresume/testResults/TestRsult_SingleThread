init only:

Starting Thread:Thread-5
Background process successfully started.

Total during time: 2 milliseconds
Waiting ... Thread-5

... suspended ...

==========================

init + destroy - without synchronized notify:

1. thread is already in waiting status

Starting Thread:Thread-5
Background process successfully started.
Waiting ... Thread-5
Start stopping processor thread in thread: main

... suspended ...

----------------------------------------------
2. thread not yet in waiting status

Starting Thread:Thread-5
Background process successfully started.
Start stopping processor thread in thread: main
Waiting ... Thread-5
Page Repainting ... Thread-5
Thread successfully stopped. Thread-5

Total during time: 1 milliseconds

============================

init + destroy - with synchronized notify:
- no matter if thread is in waiting status or not

Starting Thread:Thread-5
Background process successfully started.
Start stopping processor thread in thread: main
Waiting ... Thread-5
Page Repainting ... Thread-5
Thread successfully stopped. Thread-5

Total during time: 2 milliseconds

============================
init + flipStatus

1. flipStatus after thread in waiting status

Waiting ... Thread-5
Page Repainting ... Thread-5
Waiting ... Thread-5
Page Repainting ... Thread-5
Waiting ... Thread-5
Page Repainting ... Thread-5
Waiting ... Thread-5
Page Repainting ... Thread-5

Waiting ... Thread-5
Page Repainting ... Thread-5
Waiting ... Thread-5
Page Repainting ... Thread-5
Waiting ... Thread-5
Page Repainting ... Thread-5

... looping ...

2. flipStatus before thread in waiting status

Starting Thread:Thread-5
Background process successfully started.
Waiting ... Thread-5
Start fliping processor thread suspended status in thread: main

Total during time: 1 milliseconds
... suspended ...

===========================

init + flipStatus + destroy
-always

Starting Thread:Thread-5
Background process successfully started.
Start fliping processor thread suspended status in thread: main
Waiting ... Thread-5
Start stopping processor thread in thread: main
Page Repainting ... Thread-5
Thread successfully stopped. Thread-5

Total during time: 2 milliseconds

- conclusion:
1. looks a terminate method is needed to call anyway to stop gracefully
2. do not forget to add synchronized keyword on function with notify() call
